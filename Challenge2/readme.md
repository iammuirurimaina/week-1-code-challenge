Project Title
SPEED DETECTOR

Project Description:
This is the second Challenge in Week one's code challenge.
It is a javaScript program that takes in the input of a driver's speed and checks if the driver is overspeeding based on the speed limit. If so, it then calculates the demerit points penalized to the driver based on how much they were overspeeding.
It solves the problem of manually calculating and assigning demerit points to overspeeding drivers.
The project is entirely written in JavaScript for several reasons:
    1. It is the requirement for the course
    2. JavaScript functions and inbuilt methods allow the program to be written using less code.
    3. It is the programming Language that I am well versed in.

How to Run the Program
The program can be can run from the console.
